Zombie Escape is a popular gamemode for Counter-Strike: Source, now available for Garry's Mod. Players initially spawn as humans, and after a short amount of time, an infection outbreaks. The humans must escape the infection by reaching the end of the map, otherwise the zombies will succeed. Humans are able to 'push' zombies back with their bullets. Each weapon has their own stats, which affects the amount of push.
