Zombie Escape
=============

Zombie Escape is a popular gamemode for Counter-Strike: Source, now 
available for Garry's Mod. Players initially spawn as humans, and 
after a short amount of time, an infection outbreaks. The humans must 
escape the infection by reaching the end of the map, otherwise the 
zombies will succeed. Humans are able to 'push' zombies back with 
their bullets. Each weapon has their own stats, which affects the 
amount of push.
